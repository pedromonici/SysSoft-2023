## NOP Sled
##
## We'll overwrite the function's return address to reach our shell
## code. Rather than aiming the return exactly to the beginning of
## the injected program, though, a common practice is to prepend the
## shell code with a sequence of NOP (no-operation) instruction and
## then return to somewhare within that sequence. When the function
## 'returns', the excution flow will be deviated to the NOP sled,
## and eventually reaches our shell code.
